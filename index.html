                    My name is Daniel and I am a student in the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. I am a graduate of the University of Texas at Austin. Although I loved living in Austin, I have also loved living in Chicago for the past two years. 
                    I moved here with my girlfriend of 5 years, Amanda. 
                    <br><br> I currently work at Echo Global Logistics as an Account Executive. In my free time I enjoy playing and watching soccer, playing video games, and going to see new movies.
